`godav` is a CGI application that implement essential webdav functionalities.

`godav` design is intentionally kept as minimal as possible, leaving most of
the heavy work to whatever battle-tested http stack you want to use to deploy
it. 

`godav` is developed and used on OpenBSD, it is most probably going to operate
smoothly on any unix-like environment.
